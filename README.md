# Non-negative Matrix Fatorization in Pytorch

Pytorch is not only a good deep learning framework, but also a fast tool when it comes to matrix operations.
In this repo I implement basic NMF and NMFD examples using some pytorch functions.

In the future will compare how fast it can against scipy based implementations.
